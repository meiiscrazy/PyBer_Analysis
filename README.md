1) The purpose of Technical Analysis Deliverable 1 is to create a data frame that summarized the key metrics for a ride-sharing app by city type. I first merged both data sets by city and from there created a data frame that showed 'Total Rides', 'Total Drivers', 'Total Fares', 'Avg Fare per Driver', and 'Avg Fare per Ride'. According to the ride_driver_summary, urban cities had the most rides (1625 total rides) and fares generated ($39,854.38) but had the least average fare per ride ($24.53) and average fare per driver ($16.57). The line plot only goes from January t April but there is a trend of urban cities generating the most fares compared to other city types.

2) It was challenging to coverting the index to datetime data type. I overcame the problem by researching different methods of how to Index and also asked other people for advice on the best way to format and index the data frame. What I ended up doing was creating another "Date" column and formatting that column to a datetime type and then dropped the original "Date" column which was object type. I also struggled with plotting the line graph, at first the size of the graph wasn't right but I used figsize() to adjust the size of the graph until it reached a size I liked. 

3) I would ask CEO V. Isualize to have more drivers go out to more suburban and rural cities to decrease the disparity of total drivers between each city type. However, if CEO V. Isualize wants to focus on generating more money then they should have more drivers in urban cities since there are more riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. Another analysis on total fares in the summer, fall, and winter time could provide a more in-depth analysis since the line plot is only looking at the first four months. There could be a drop in riders depending on the month. To perform this analysis I would change the range I set on my dataframe to include the first date and last date of the data set, and then graph the new dataset.
